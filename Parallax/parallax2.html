		<h2>PART 1-THE BEGINNING</h2>
		<p>Satin Bow had an idea to live forever. She would upload a figment of herself into a computer, so she could live on forever in the internet.</p>
		<p>Getting ideas for her plan, she grabbed a computer and got to work.</p>

		<h2>PART 2-THE RISING ACTION</h2>
	    <p>She didn't know the consequences, though. By uploading herself into the internet, she killed her physical body, leaving her trapped in the computer with no way out.</p>
		<p>As she awoke in the computer, she looked around, realizing that she didn't know how to travel around. She was able to move through the computer as if she were flying, and she could generate objects to keep herself busy, but she could not interact with the outside world, nor could she explore the other electronics nearby.</p>

		<h2>PART 3-THE ENDING</h2>
	    <p>She had somewhat of a boring life. Or, well, an afterlife. She eventually figured out how to leave the computer and jump into an arcade machine, but then she was stuck in there too.</p>
		<p>Many years later, after the arcade was abandoned, a pair broke into the arcade, and toppled over her machine, breaking the screen. She managed to temporarily escape as a hologram to scare the two, and before she was dragged back into the machine, she grabbed the pair and brought them in with her, trapping them in there with her. She finally could interact with the outside world, and she had a pair of accomplices to prove it.</p>
		<p>She managed to figure out how to freely travel between electronics, even being able to corrupt signals, and the rest is a story that needs to be told. But not now.</p>
		<p>Someday, though...</p>
